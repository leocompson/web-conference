Web Meeting extension enables you to easily make online meetings (video & audio conference with chat) in your browser. Simply write a nickname, choose a meeting name and password, and then click on the join button to create or join a meeting. If a meeting with the given name already exists, you will be joined to the existing meeting, otherwise, a new meeting room will be created with the given name. Anyone with this username and password can join the created meeting. 

You can change the interface template via the template button on the left toolbar. There is also a toggle button to connect or disconnect the app from the WebSocket server. This web application is using WebSocket and WebRTC technologies to make the online conference room. For the WebSocket connection, currently, it uses https://repl.co - cloud application platform. It also uses server.js - opensource project in GitHub (https://github.com/chandler-stimson/meeting/blob/master/server/server.js) to make the WSS server. You can change this server within the app UI by clicking on the settings button. Once the meeting connection is initiated, the app uses WebRTC for all the communications between peers. Therefore the WebSocket connection is no longer needed and automatically disconnects.

You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
